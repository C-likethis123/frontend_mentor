  If migrating from a large project, we can use `box-sizing: inherit`

    Typographic tweaks!
    3. Add accessible line-height 
    - the default tends to be 1.2, but for those who are dyslexic, the lines are packed too closely together.
    - override this value on headings as it's too large for headings
    - there's also a thing about line heights: using the font size as a base, and adds a fixed amount of space to each line.
    4. Improve text rendering
    - on macOS, the browser will use subpixel antialiasing. It aims to make text easier to read and improved text contrast.
    - but on modern hardware, subpixel antialiasing was doing more harm than good.
    - MacOS browsers still use subpixel antialiasing by default, so we need to turn it off

    5. Improve media defaults
    Images are considered inline elements, that implies they should be used in the middle of paragraphs.
    But most of the time we treat them as layout elements.
    If we use it as an inline element, there are weird things that happen like adding a 4px gap.

    Set max-width: 100% to keep large images from overflowing their container.
    Most block level elements grow/shrink to fix their parent. But media elements are known as replaced elements, and they don't follow the same rules. It will retain its original dimensions even when placed in a smaller container.

/*
    6. Remove built-in form typography styles
    By default, buttons and inputs don't inherit typographical styles from their parents, but have their own styles
    In mobile, it will result in autozoom behaviour. To avoid this behaviour, the inputs need to have a font-size of at least 1rem/16px.
    By setting it to inherit, we instruct these elements to match the typography in their surrounding environments

    7. Avoid text overflows
    By default, the algorithm will look for soft-wrap opportunities - whitespace and hyphens.
    If a line does not have soft wrap, and it doesn't fit, it will cause the text to overflow.

    8. Create a root stacking context
